# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide provides solutions to common issues encountered while working with Device OS.

## Common Issues

### 1. Build Failures
**Symptoms:**
- Compilation errors during the build process.
- Missing dependencies or tools.

**Solutions:**
- Ensure all required tools are installed (e.g., GCC, Make).
- Run the following command to install dependencies:
  ```bash
  ./ci/install_boost.sh
  ```
- Check the `build/` directory for detailed logs.

### 2. Device Not Connecting to Network
**Symptoms:**
- Device fails to connect to Wi-Fi or cellular network.
- Network state stuck in `DISCONNECTED`.

**Solutions:**
- Verify network credentials are correct.
- Check if the network is available and has sufficient signal strength.
- Use the following command to reset network settings:
  ```bash
  particle device wifi
  ```

### 3. LED Blink Patterns Not Working
**Symptoms:**
- Custom LED patterns are not applied.
- LED remains off or blinks unexpectedly.

**Solutions:**
- Ensure the pattern string is valid (e.g., `"1010"` for on/off sequence).
- Check the `spark_wiring_led.cpp` file for errors.

### 4. Power Consumption Logs Missing
**Symptoms:**
- No logs related to power consumption appear.
- Battery level always shows `-1`.

**Solutions:**
- Verify the device is running on battery power.
- Check the `spark_wiring_power.cpp` file for issues.

## Debugging Tips
- Use the `Log.info()` function to add debug logs in the code.
- Check the `logs/` directory for runtime logs.
- Use the Particle CLI for device diagnostics:
  ```bash
  particle device doctor
  ```
