## Tinker Application

The Tinker application provides a simple interface for interacting with the pins and features of your Particle device. It includes functions for digital and analog I/O, as well as WiFi signal strength and battery level monitoring.

### Available Functions

1. **Digital Read**
   - Reads the digital value of a pin.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     particle call <device_name> digitalread D7
     ```

2. **Digital Write**
   - Sets a pin to HIGH or LOW.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     particle call <device_name> digitalwrite D7,HIGH
     ```

3. **Analog Read**
   - Reads the analog value of a pin.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     particle call <device_name> analogread A0
     ```

4. **Analog Write**
   - Writes an analog value (PWM) to a pin.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     particle call <device_name> analogwrite D0,128
     ```

5. **WiFi Signal Strength**
   - Retrieves the current WiFi signal strength in dBm.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     particle call <device_name> wifiSignal
     ```

6. **Battery Level**
   - Retrieves the current battery level as a percentage.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     particle call <device_name> batteryLevel
     ```

### Notes
- Ensure your device is connected to the Particle Cloud before using these functions.
- For more details, refer to the inline comments in the source code.

## I2C Scanner Utility

The I2C scanner utility allows you to detect devices connected to the I2C bus. It scans all valid I2C addresses and returns the addresses of the detected devices.

### Usage Example

```cpp
#include "spark_wiring_i2c.h"

void setup() {
    uint8_t addresses[10];
    int count = I2CScan(addresses, 10);

    if (count > 0) {
        for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
            Serial.printf("Found device at address: 0x%02X\n", addresses[i]);
        }
    } else {
        Serial.println("No I2C devices found.");
    }
}

void loop() {
    // Your code here
}
```

## Performance Improvements

### Optimized String Operations
- Improved `String::concat` for efficient concatenation.
- Added optimized `String::substring` for extracting substrings.
- Enhanced `Print::print` for better handling of `String` objects.

### Usage Examples

#### String Concatenation
```cpp
String str("Hello");
str.concat(" World");
Serial.println(str); // Output: Hello World
```

#### String Substring
```cpp
String str("Hello World");
String sub = str.substring(6, 11);
Serial.println(sub); // Output: World
```

#### Printing Strings
```cpp
String str("Hello World");
Serial.print(str); // Output: Hello World
```

## ADC Calibration Process

Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) calibration ensures accurate analog readings by compensating for hardware variations. This process is essential for applications requiring precise analog measurements.

### When to Calibrate
- After manufacturing or hardware changes.
- When using a new device for the first time.
- Periodically, to maintain accuracy over time.

### How to Calibrate
1. Use the `adcCalibrate()` function provided in the wiring API.
2. Ensure the ADC input pins are in a known state (e.g., connected to ground or a reference voltage).
3. Call the function in your setup code:

```cpp
#include "spark_wiring_adc.h"

void setup() {
    if (adcCalibrate()) {
        Serial.println("ADC Calibration Successful");
    } else {
        Serial.println("ADC Calibration Failed");
    }
}

void loop() {
    // Your code here
}
```

### Notes
- Calibration may take a few seconds to complete.
- Ensure stable power supply during calibration.
- Refer to the detailed guide in `docs/adc_calibration.md` for more information.

## Cloud Reconnection Retry Logic

This feature introduces retry logic for reconnecting to the cloud in case of disconnection. It attempts to reconnect multiple times with a fixed interval between attempts.

### Configuration
- **Maximum Retries**: 5
- **Retry Interval**: 5000 ms (5 seconds)

### Usage Example

```cpp
#include "system_cloud.h"

void setup() {
    cloud_reconnection_init();
    if (cloud_reconnect_with_retry()) {
        Serial.println("Reconnected to the cloud successfully.");
    } else {
        Serial.println("Failed to reconnect to the cloud.");
    }
}

void loop() {
    // Your code here
}
```
